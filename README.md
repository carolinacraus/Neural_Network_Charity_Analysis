# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview

Using Python's TensorFlow library, the purpose of this project was to use deep learning neural networks to analyze the impact of each donation, vet potential receipents, and help ensure that the foundation money is being used effectively.

### Tasks 
    - Predict which organizations are worth domating to and which are high risk 
    - Create a mathematical driven solution to design and train a deep learning neural network
    - Model will evaluate all kinds of input data and produce a clear decision making result

### Deliverables

    1. Preprocess Data for a Neural Network Model 
    2. Compile, Train, & Evaluate the Model 
    3. Optimize the Model 

## Results

### Data Preprocessing

- The **IS_SUCCESSFUL** variable is considered the target(s) for the  model
- The variables considered to be the features for the model are: 
  - APPLICATION_TYPE
  - AFFILIATION
  - CLASSIFICATION
  - USE_CASE
  - ORGANIZATION STATUS
  - INCOME_AMT
  - SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS
  -  ASK_AMT
- The columns **EIN** and **NAME** contain information pertaining to identification and are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data.

### Compiling, Training, & Evaluating

- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
